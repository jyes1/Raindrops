In this project raindrops fall from the top of the screen. They fall with slightly different velocities and locations. They fall to the bottom of the screen and accelerate slightly. Every 2 seconds, five more raindrops are released, and every 5 seconds there is a flash of lightning. When they touch the catcher, they disappear and the catcher's radius increades slightly for every 1 raindrop. The goal of this game is to catch as many raindrops as you can within the time limit of 15 seconds. after the fifteen seconds it flashes to the game over screen. Catching the raindrops are challenging because the picture is meant to throw you off their track. So how many can you catch?
