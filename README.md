In this project, raindrops fall from the top of the screen. As they get to the bottom of the screen, they will accelerate slightly, causing them to look very realistic. When they touch the (moving) catcher, the catcher's radius will increase. But once it reaches a certain radius, the game will end, and the person will have the option to start over. The background is rain to make it look cool. Additionally, there is a cloud that flashes lightning every few seconds.
