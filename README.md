In this project, blue raindrops fall from the top of the screen. They will fall five at a time every two seconds. Lightning will flash every five seconds. They fall at slightly different velocities, and from slightly different places. As they get to the bottom of the screen, they will accelerate slightly, causing them to look very realistic. When they touch the (moving) catcher, the catcher's radius will increase. After 10 seconds pass, the program will read "game over. close and restart." The background is rain to make it look cool. I've organized it into tabs Additionally, there is a cloud that flashes lightning every few seconds.
