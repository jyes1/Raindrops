The game starts with a white screen. to begin you must click inside the box labeled: click the box to start. The raindrops fall from the top of the screen with slightly different velocities and locations. They fall to the bottom of the screen and accelerate slightly. Every 2 seconds, five more raindrops are released. Every 3 seconds there is a flash of lightning coming out from a cloud. Use the left and right arrow keys to catch the raindrops, and use the scoreboards to keep track of your score. The stopwatch clock is added to give you an idea of how long youâ€™ve been playing, and to serve as your score. When they touch the catcher, they disappear and the catcher's radius increases slightly for every 1 raindrop caught. the game ends after you miss more than 49 raindrops, so the goal of the game is to last as long as you can. Once the game is finished you must close the window and restart.  So now the question remains: how many can you catch?
